# ML-Algorithm-Logistic-Regression-

In this Jupyter Notebook, I have applied Logistic Regression Machine Learning Algorithm to Heart disease dataset from Cleaveland Database to predict exercise induced angina in patients. I achieved an accuracy of 72% which is pretty decent. In this notebook I have made a detailed report on Logistic Regression along with the complete implementation of my project. I have covered from Analyzing of Data to Data Wrangling and finally I Trained the Model to achieve a prediction success rate of 72%. I will perform the same task for various other ML Algorithms and add all of those reports to my Github repositories while making it public so that it's accessible to everyone for use. 

## How to Run?

Step 1 - Download the zip file and extract it to a directory.

Step 2 - Go to that specific directory using your comand line/Terminal

Step 3 - Run Jupyter Notebbook in that directory where you stored the file 

Step 4 - Once the Jupyter Notebook is opened, click on the Disease.ipynb file and run all the cells.

### What's next?
Right now, i am working in a very big Project, that is under health domain as well. I am making a very detailed report on my Heart Disease Predictor. I am putting in everything i know into that , from all the techniques of feature selection to getting the best correlation to using the Best ML Algorithm in respect to accuracy. Even doing Parameter Optimization once i find the best Algo to further imporve the accuracy. I am putting all in onto that, that Jupyter notebook will contain all the code and i will document each and every line of it along with the results. The Project? To put it in layman's terms, My project will predict if a patient has a risk of heart diseade or not based on the patient's reports from variuoys genral medical tests for attributes like BMI, WC, HbA1c, FPG, TC, TG, HDL, LDL, FI, hsCRP, GENSINI score, and other lifestyle features like if the patient smokes, drinks alcohol, does exercise or the amnount of calorie intake/burn. I am super excited to complete this project and share it with you all as soon as possible. Expected Completion date : till end of July, 2020.
